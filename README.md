# SortNames_Assessment
To run this project you will need to change the file path in nameSorter.cs and nameSorterTests.cs files.

Code inside nameSorter.cs file is used to sort the names and code inside nameSorterTests.cs file is used for unit tests. 

By running this code it will sort the provided text file, display sorted names on the screen and will save the sorted names in sorted-names-list.txt file.

This code will first try to sort the names according to last name and then it will sort according to given names.

This code will also check for minimum 1 given name and upto 3 given names.

This code will ignore extra spaces btween two names in text file.

I have created five test cases and all test cases are successful.

All Test case files are provided in testFiles folder.
